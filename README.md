## What is MCP?

[MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs. Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications. Just as USB-C provides a standardized way to connect your devices to various peripherals and accessories, MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools.

## What is DeMCP?

DeMCP is the first decentralized MCP network and a core infrastructure between AI and Web3. It focuses on providing Agents with self-developed and open-source MCP services, offering MCP developers a deployment platform with commercial revenue sharing, and enabling one-stop access to mainstream large language models (LLMs). By supporting crypto payments (USDT, USDC), DeMCP allows global developers to participate easily. Combined with TEE and a blockchain registry, DeMCP redefines the security and reliability of MCP, accelerating the advancement of the Agent industry.
